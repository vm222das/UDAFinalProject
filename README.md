# UDAFinalProject
# The code is for my submission for the UDA Final Project
# The code runs a number of classifers and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network on the Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset
# The dataset is automatically downloaded when the code is run from torch_geometric.datasets import EllipticBitcoinDataset 
# The raw data files are stored in the ./raw directory and then accessed as the code runs
